# TotalTracker

Spigot 1.11 plugin to keep track of all kinds of stats. See description for a current list.

**This requires MySQL**   
I do not plan to develop this for other databases for several reasons, sorry!

# Description
Note: This requires Java 1.8+

All stats are processed asynchronously so your server never experiences any lag.  
Stats will automatically be imported from bukkit/spigot statistics(This will occur on player login).

This will keep track of many stats, currently:
- PvP kills
- Deaths
- Mob kills
- Blocks broken
- Blocks placed
- Logins
- Damage Taken
- Damage Caused
- Items Picked Up
- Chat Messages
- Items Crafted
- XP Gained
- Time Played
- Food Eaten
- Items Dropped
- Items Enchanted
- Arrows Shot
